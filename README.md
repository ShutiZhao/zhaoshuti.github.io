## About Me

I am a graduate student in the **MS in Data Science for Public Policy** program at Georgetown University.  
I graduated from the **University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)**, where I majored in **History and Sociology**.

My academic background trained me to think critically about social systems, institutions, and long-term structural change. During my master’s program, I transitioned into data science and developed technical skills in programming, statistics, and applied machine learning.

After graduation, I aim to pursue a career in a **technology firm**, where I can apply data-driven methods and a policy-oriented perspective to real-world problems.
